# Fashion MNIST Classification with Neural Networks

🎯 This project implements a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify grayscale images of clothing (28x28 px) from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

🧠 The model is trained to distinguish between 10 types of fashion items (e.g. shirts, sneakers, coats, etc.)
